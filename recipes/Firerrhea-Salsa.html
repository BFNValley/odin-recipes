        <h1>Firerrhea Salsa</h1>
        <p>     This recipe is one I found on a 4chan thread. I was browsing the /x/ board and one post said "This thread is boring, here's a Salsa Recipe".
            I appreciated that, so I decided to save it.
        </p>
        <p>
                The name does not lie, this salsa is SPICY, and will leave your stomach hurting something fierce if you eat too much of it. Proceed with caution.
